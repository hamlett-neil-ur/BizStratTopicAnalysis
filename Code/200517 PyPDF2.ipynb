       "'54 G. von Krogh, J. Roos and K. Slocum transformations in contemporary society and economics and in the phenomenon we call the organization. Indicators of these transformations are many. In education, knowledge has become increasingly differentiated as a result of increasing efforts in research and development: there is no longer a ‚right knowledge,™ but many coexisting conflicting pieces of knowledge. In turn, the contest between different elements of knowledge continually increases the complexity of total knowledge conveyed through education (Lyotard, 1984; Lawson and Appignanesi, 1989; Hage and Powers, 1992). Further indicators may be discovered in the arts, which, according to Sakaiya (1992: 148), ‚. .is a field of human endeavor that tends to be in the forefront of any imminent social transformation.™ Contemporary art presents itself in a way that is different from historical art; it combines elements from many epochs in new ways (Lyotard, 1984). In philosophy, the coming of a postmodern age and its implications for individuals and societies at large are being surveyed and debated (i.e., Habermas, 1992). Another indicator is the general shift in the economy from diminishing to increasing returns on resources in many industries (Arthur, 1990). The most important signals to the strategic management field include: the advent of information technology and new organizational forms (Sproull and Kiesler, 1991); corporate programs to fusion various types of technologies (Kodoma, 1992); the emergence of new forms of manufacturing (Drucker, 1990); the implementation of competitive alliances, i.e., collaboration among competitors (Hamel, DOZ, and Prahalad, 1988); the coming of new activity-based accounting systems (Johnson and Kaplan, 1987; Johnson, 1992); and the availability of life-long learning programs as a partnership between the individual and the educational institution (Lorange, 1992; Ghoshal, Arnzen, and Brownfield, 1992). Consequences of these signals have been addressed by various authors (Davidow and Malone, 1992; Badaracco, 1991; Fombrun, 1992; Hamel and Prahalad, 1989,1993; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Hamel, 1991). An important conclusion to be drawn from this work is that we need to develop a better understanding of the organization as a knowledge system. We suggest that the organization can be seen as a stream of knowledge. This means that the organization, as we have come to know it during the past century, is an inaccurate concept. Likewise, our management practices and theories need to be discarded, altered, or reinvented in order to give adequate descriptions and provide appropriate heuristics that can guide managers in this new knowledge-intensive era. That is exactly what this paper will address. The essay consists of three main sections. First, our methodological approach is discussed. Second, our speculation on a new corporate epistemology is presented. Building on this epistemology, in the third section we discuss the further advancement of the realm of strategic management. METHODOLOGY: A PROCESS OF MATCHING Not surprisingly, theorists in the field to an increasing extent seem to acknowledge that the process of strategic management research and results of research are closely connected (Chakravarthy and DOZ, 1992; Lorange et al., 1993). This is in accordance with the well-known Principle of Indeterminism discovered by Werner Heisenberg in the mid 1920~.~ In short, this principle acknowledges that observation influences what is seen and vice versa. Thus, any attempt to truly rethink the boundaries of strategic management must acknowledge this effect and, therefore, simultaneously cause a rethinking of the research approach. When we wonder about something, we not only need to look for answers to questions never asked before, we need to become inventive about ways of finding out things. Otherwise, methodology may become a severe constraint on the degree of novelty in the knowledge produced. Because the process of finding new meaning in the ideas of strategic management essentially is a creative process, the theories and perspectives developed still require sufficient grounding in practical relevance. Our research approach tries The uncertainty principle, or principle of indeterminism, was discovered (or rather, it was reaffirmed by the Greek Zen0 of Elea™s objection that an object cannot occupy a given place and be moving at the same time) when Heisenberg was struggling to rethink the boundaries of the quantum world that would accord with the new quantum mechanics (for a fuller discussion, see Heisenberg, 1971).

Becker’s (1964) seminal work emphasizes\\nthe strategic importance of firm-specific human cap-\\nital over general human capital. Building on that,\\nCampbell, Coff, and Kryscynski (2012) forward a\\ntheory explaining that firm-specific human capital\\ncan also be valuable to other firms, since it reflects\\nan employee’s willingness and ability to invest\\nin\\nlearning new skills.

Interestingly, while con-\\ntrolling for repeat client projects, we found no effect\\nfor projects that were executed with the same client\\nin the past. However, the control for the number of\\nconcurrent projects associated with the same client\\nin a given year was significantly and positively cor-\\nrelated with project performance. One reason for\\nthis anomaly could be that project\\nteams are dis-\\nsolved after project completion and team members\\nmove on to new projects with different clients; so\\nmuch of the client-specific knowledge learned dur-\\ning project execution is lost. Repeat projects from\\nthe same client\\nin later years cannot capture this\\nknowledge, because a new team is created to deliver\\nthe repeat project. If, however, several projects are\\nexecuted for\\nthe same client\\nsimultaneously,\\nthis\\nloss of client-specific knowledge is reduced, since\\nthe teams can easily interact, exchange information,\\nand resolve project-related problems. This also has\\nthe potential\\nto reduce managerial overheads and\\nimproves economies of learning associated with the\\nsame client. During multiple visits to the firm head-\\nquarters, we learned that all projects conducted for\\na particular client are housed in the same physical\\nspace (floor or building) to enable information shar-\\ning across projects and to improve learning efficien-\\ncies. We believe this is one of the reasons why repeat\\nprojects conducted in later years do not show any\\nperformance impact, while multiple projects exe-\\ncuted simultaneously with the same client show a\\nsignificant positive impact on performance.\\n\\nEvaluating selection bias\\n\\nSelection can be a concern in our empirical\\nset-\\nting if\\nthe most competent employees are system-\\natically staffed in projects which then turn out\\nto\\nbe highly profitable. This might happen if,\\nin con-\\njunction with HR staff, a project manager\\nidenti-\\nfies those employees scoring high on certification\\nexams\\nand\\nselects\\na\\nteam composed\\nof\\nthe\\ntop\\nscorers, and/or\\nselects a team of employees with\\nvery high experience. In such situations, any perfor-\\nmance benefits resulting from a certification-exam\\ninitiative or on-the-job learning may be due not\\nto\\nformal or\\ninformal\\nlearning, but\\nrather\\nto select-\\ning the\\nsmartest or most\\nexperienced employees\\nand excluding employees with low scores or\\nlittle\\nexperience.\\nTo evaluate these issues, it is important to exam-\\nine how software development projects are staffed.\\nDetailed interviews with executives at the focal firm\\n\\nStrat.

The software industry is very competi-\\ntive: major multinationals such as IBM, Accenture,\\nHP, TCS,\\nInfosys, Wipro, HCL,\\nand Cognizant\\ncompete for customer projects. Such firms do not\\nhave much latitude in terms of estimates, since any\\nslack may lead to losing a project. At the focal firm,\\na project manager is assigned to a project after a cus-\\ntomer agrees to the effort and schedule estimates;\\nthese provide detailed guidelines of\\nthe types of\\npeople needed to work on the project (e.g., “a Dot\\nNet programmer with five years’ experience”). The\\nproject manager does not\\nselect\\nspecific employ-\\nees\\nfor projects.\\nInstead, a staffing group recom-\\nmends\\nsoftware\\nengineers based on the\\nrequired\\nskills and experience detailed in the initial estimates\\nguideline. Generally, employees are engaged in one\\nproject at a time, and after the project\\nis complete,\\nteam members are released to work on new opportu-\\nnities that are available at that time. A project man-\\nager cannot hold onto the best software engineers\\nindefinitely after completion of a project, especially\\ngiven the constrained supply of software engineers\\nin recent years and the high utilization rate of engi-\\nneers needed to meet margin requirements.\\nIf\\na\\nsoftware engineer\\nis engaged for a client project,\\nhe or\\nshe becomes a billable resource that earns\\nmoney for the firm, but even when benched, the firm\\nmust still pay the engineer’s salary. During inter-\\nviews, senior executives and project managers at the\\nfocal firm mentioned that\\nthey did not have access\\nto the certification exam scores because the exam\\nwas administered by a separate division (Education\\nand Research) and employee scores were confiden-\\ntial. The managers categorically denied the idea of\\nchoosing project\\nteams based on employees’ cer-\\ntification exam scores. Perhaps more important\\nis\\nthat\\nthe employee utilization rate at\\nthe focal firm\\nwas above 85 percent, which means that at any time\\nonly 15 percent of employees were available to staff\\nnew projects. Project managers had only limited\\nability to select\\nthe\\nsmartest\\nengineers\\nfor\\ntheir\\nproject\\nteam, since they were not allowed to select\\nemployees who were already engaged in ongoing\\nprojects.\\nTo\\ncheck whether managers\\nuse\\ncertification\\nexamination performance or employee experience\\nas a criterion for\\nstaffing projects, we conducted\\ntests to see whether any exam scores or experience\\nmeasures were significantly related to a project’s\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\noriginal size (function point measure16 ), schedule,\\nand effort estimates. These three variables are usu-\\nally based on managers’ assessments of a project’s\\ncomplexity at\\nthe time the firm receives the con-\\ntract and can be considered proxies of project com-\\nplexity. Over\\nthe duration of a project,\\nthe actual\\nschedule and amount of effort can change, caus-\\ning overruns and slippages, which are costly for the\\nfirm (evidenced by the negative impact on project\\nperformance shown in Model 1, Table 2). A signifi-\\ncant relationship could mean that staffing executives\\nanticipated that\\nthe project would be complex and\\ntherefore created a team composed of those employ-\\nees who had performed best on the\\ncertification\\nexams as well as those with the most experience.

Chatterjee\\n\\ngives us confidence that selection in and of\\nitself\\nwas not\\nthe main driver for the results reported in\\nthis paper.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nIn\\nthis\\npaper, we\\ninvestigated\\nhow firm perfor-\\nmance is affected by capabilities developed through\\ndeliberate investments in human assets to upgrade\\nemployees’ general knowledge and skills through\\ndifferent types of learning mechanisms. We argued\\nthat\\ncapabilities develop over\\ntime\\nthrough vari-\\nous path-dependent processes, such as learning by\\ndoing and deliberate sustained investments of capi-\\ntal and resources. We identified two different capa-\\nbilities that are critical for success in the global IT\\nservices\\nindustry: business-domain capability and\\ntechnological capability. The focal firm made delib-\\nerate\\ninvestments\\nin general human capital with\\nthe strategic intent of developing these capabilities\\nand competing successfully with established for-\\neign rivals. These investments bore fruit. The results\\nsuggest\\nthat firms\\ncan develop these\\ncapabilities\\nthrough formal methods, such as specialized train-\\ning and evaluation, or\\ninformal methods,\\nsuch as\\nexperiential learning.\\nWe\\ndeveloped\\nfour\\nhypotheses\\nto\\nreflect\\nthe\\ninterplay of\\nthese different methods of develop-\\ning\\ncapabilities. The\\nresults\\nsupported\\nthe\\ntwo\\nhypotheses\\nthat addressed business-domain capa-\\nbility. One unit of increase in business-domain com-\\npetence score resulted in a 0.24 percent17\\nincrease\\nin project profits. The same investment aimed at\\ndeveloping technological capability, however, did\\nnot yield dividends. Such certifications did enhance\\nthe\\ntechnical\\nknowledge\\nof\\nemployees,\\nbut\\nthis\\nknowledge did not\\ntranslate into superior perfor-\\nmance in developing better software applications.\\nOne explanation may be that\\ntechnological knowl-\\nedge is more codifiable: once employees learn tech-\\nnical knowledge during their\\ninitial\\ntraining after\\njoining\\nthe\\nfirm,\\nthey\\ncan\\napply\\nit\\non\\nthe\\njob\\nto enhance project performance. Over\\ntime, extra\\ntraining and certifications may not\\nadd much to\\nemployees’\\ntechnological expertise. After discus-\\nsions with employees at\\nthe focal firm,\\nit became\\n\\napparent\\nthat\\nthe technology certifications were at\\nsuch a high level\\nthat\\nthe knowledge\\nthey certi-\\nfied was not readily usable for client projects. The\\nmanagers\\njustified\\nthese\\ncertifications\\nby\\nsaying\\nthat\\nthis knowledge would be useful\\nin the future\\n(Chatterjee, 2011). Domain knowledge, on the other\\nhand,\\nis more subjective and tacit and thus\\nrela-\\ntively difficult\\nto codify. However, certain aspects\\nof domain knowledge can be codified in the form\\nof training manuals and certification exams. These\\ncodifications\\nof\\ndomain\\nknowledge\\ncreate\\nvalue\\nbecause employees can use them in actual project\\nwork in a relatively straightforward manner.\\nSimilarly,\\nbusiness-domain\\nexpertise\\naccu-\\nmulated\\nover\\nseveral\\nyears\\nof\\nproject\\nexecution\\nexperience\\nin the\\nclient’s\\nindustry appears\\nto be\\nmore\\nvaluable\\nthan\\ntechnological\\nexperience.\\nA one-unit\\nincrease\\nin\\nbusiness-domain\\nexpe-\\nrience\\nresulted\\nin\\na\\n0.21 percent18\\nincrease\\nin\\nproject profits. Employees with higher\\nlevels of\\nbusiness-domain\\nexperience\\nadequately\\ncompen-\\nsate for\\ntheir\\nincreased salary by making superior\\ncontributions\\nto\\nproject\\nperformance. Therefore,\\nwe find that while investment\\nin business-domain\\ncapabilities\\n(through\\nfocused\\ncoursework\\nand\\ncertification\\nevaluation\\nexaminations)\\ncreated\\nvalue;\\ninvestment\\nin technological capabilities did\\nnot\\nresult\\nin similar payoff. After discussing this\\nwith senior managers at\\nthe focal firm,\\nit became\\nclear that with increased technological experience,\\nroles\\nand\\nresponsibilities\\nbecome more\\ncom-\\nplex. Employees with greater experience take on\\nresponsibilities for project- and client-expectations\\nmanagement, which leads to increased performance\\nchallenges. Even\\nthough\\nproject managers\\nhave\\nsignificant\\ntechnological\\nexperience,\\nthey do not\\nget\\ninvolved in developing software. Therefore the\\nlack of significance of our technological experience\\nvariable could also be attributed to obsolescence\\n(Pazy, 1996; Thompson, 2007).\\nThe\\nresults\\nsuggest\\nthat\\ntechnological\\nskills\\nare\\na\\nnecessary\\nbut\\nnot\\nsufficient\\ncondition\\nfor\\nearning\\nhigher\\nprofits.

Since this firm has been and continues\\nto be highly profitable (average annual profitabil-\\nity after\\ntax has been more than 25% for\\nthe past\\ndecade),\\nthis study justifies human capital\\ninvest-\\nments in the form of general\\ntraining and certifi-\\ncation exams, even though it may be valuable to\\ncompetitors. In knowledge-based industries such as\\nIT services, capability upgrade through continuous\\nlearning is\\nthe only way to maintain competitive\\nparity, due to the rapid change in technologies and\\ncustomers’ business\\nrequirements.\\nIn fact, one of\\nthe founders of the firm commented,\\n\\n“A knowledge company can only prosper by\\ninvesting in its employees.”\\n\\nIn response to my queries about\\nthe possibility\\nthat\\nrivals\\ncould\\npoach\\ncertified\\ntalent,\\nthe\\nvice\\npresident of human resources expressed this view:\\n\\n“I tell employees who plan to quit after tak-\\ning a few certifications, ‘These certifications\\noffered by our company are like stock options\\nthat\\ncontinuously\\nenhance\\nyour\\nskills\\nand,\\nhence,\\nyour market\\nvalue.
