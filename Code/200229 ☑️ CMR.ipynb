    "## Purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we collect abstracts and titles from [*California Management Review*](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/browse/issues/).  This information is to be used as part of an attempt to apply text classification to charting the progression of business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles and abstracts are available without paywall login. But we have to do this in ***three stages***.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⓵ **Get the URL for the each volume**. We start with the journal's hope page.  Our essential information is embedded in a frame depicted below on the right-hand side of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓶ **Get a list of issue URLs**.  Each volume page contains thumbnail images of individual issues. These include URLs to the individual isses. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓷ **Collect lists of titles**.  Follow each issue's URL to its issue table of contents. The tables of contents contain titles, as well as URLs to pages for individual articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "⓸ **Collect abstracts**.  Abstracts are accessible from individual articles. We have to get the abstracts from these individual-article pages.\n",
