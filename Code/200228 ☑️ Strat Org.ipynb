    "## Purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we collect abstracts and titles from [*Strategic Organization*](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/soq).  This information is to be used as part of an attempt to apply text classification to charting the progression of business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles and abstracts are available without paywall login. But we have to do this in ***three stages***.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⓵ **Get the URL for the each volume**. We start with the journal's hope page.  Our essential information is embedded in a frame depicted below on the right-hand side of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓶ **Get a list of issue URLs**.  Each volume page contains thumbnail images of individual issues. These include URLs to the individual isses. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓷ **Collect lists of titles**.  Follow each issue's URL to its issue table of contents. The tables of contents contain titles, as well as URLs to pages for individual articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "⓸ **Collect abstracts**.  Abstracts are accessible from individual articles. We have to get the abstracts from these individual-article pages.\n",

       "    'abstract': 'status and reputation have often been treated as synonyms. these concepts, however, arise from disconnected literatures in which they had quite distinct connotations. this article explores the similarities and differences between these theoretical constructs, discusses the extent to which research in the management literature has captured one versus the other, and proposes a path for moving forward our understanding of these concepts.'},\n",

       "    'abstract': 'sustainability is fast becoming fashionable in strategic management, and yet its meaning is often elusive. some people restrict sustainability to environmental issues, and others use it synonymously with corporate social responsibility. in this essay, we return to the roots of its original meaning and argue that sustainability requires the consideration of time. sustainability obliges firms to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. in this essay, we clarify the meaning of sustainability by showing that the notion of ‘time’ discriminates sustainability from responsibility and other similar concepts. we then argue that the omission of time from most strategic management has contributed to short-termism, which is the bane sustainability. we conclude with directions for future research that will integrate sustainability into strategy and contribute to a world in which both business and society can thrive for generations to come.'},\n",
