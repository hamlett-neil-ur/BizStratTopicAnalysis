    "## Purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we collect abstracts and titles from [*Strategic Management Journal*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970266), flagship publication of the [Strategic Management Society](https://www.strategicmanagement.net/).  This information is to be used as part of an attempt to apply text classification to charting the progression of business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles and abstracts are available without paywall login. But we have to do this in ***three stages***.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⓵ **Get the URL for the each volume**. We start with the journal's hope page.  Our essential information is embedded in a frame depicted below on the right-hand side of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓶ **Get a list of issue URLs**.  Each volume page contains thumbnail images of individual issues. These include URLs to the individual isses. \n",
    "\n",
    "⓷ **Collect lists of titles**.  Follow each issue's URL to its issue table of contents. The tables of contents contain titles, as well as URLs to pages for individual articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "⓸ **Collect abstracts**.  Abstracts are accessible from individual articles. We have to get the abstracts from these individual-article pages.\n",

       "      'abstract': \"in this paper, three points are argued. the first is that ronald coase, best known as the forefather of transaction cost theory, foresaw many of the critical questions that proponents of the resource‐based view are concerned with today. the second is that resource‐based theory plays a potentially much more critical role in economic theory and in explaining the institutional structure of production than even many resource‐based scholars recognize. the last point is that a more complete understanding of the organization of economic activity requires a greater sensitivity to the interdependence of production and exchange relations. the arguments presented in this paper highlight important, but relatively ignored, elements in coase's work that inform strategy research. more importantly, this paper makes the case for a triangular alignment between the triumvirate of governance structure, transaction, and resource attributes and demonstrates how the identity and strategy of a particular firm influences how its resources interact with the transaction and how the firm chooses to govern it. the general argument is then applied to the context of interfirm collaborative relations, where the key focus is broadened from just cost to also include skills/knowledge and the interdependence between cost and skills with respect to firm boundaries, both in terms of choice and nature. such a broadening of focus enables us to additionally examine the transacting process as a productive endeavor, which underpins the co‐evolution of the competencies of partner firms. copyright © 2002 john wiley & sons, ltd.\"}}},\n",
