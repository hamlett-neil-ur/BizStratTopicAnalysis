\begin_layout Abstract
A 
\emph on
big-data
\emph default
 text-mining analysis detects prominent themes in the business-strategy
 literature.
 A 
\emph on
Latent Dirichlet Allocation
\emph default
 (LDA) model is applied to a corpus comprised of journal-article titles
 and abstracts from eight journals spanning the period 1980 – 2020.
 This corpus consists of around 5,500 documents containing an aggregate
 of 1.25 million words.
 Five prominent business-strategy themes are identified 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
.
 The LDA model based on the aforementioned corpus is applied to eight articles
 known to coincide with the dominant themes.
 These known-theme documents are found to correspond to distinct topics
 inferred by the model.
 Substantial overlap exists, making thematic discrimination challenging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Subsequent work for the INFORMS Annual Meeting will seek to improve the
 thematic-discriminant power of the approach.
 This includes expanding the corpus size to include full-text articles.
 More-sophisticated modeling will attempt to pull in additional grammatical
 information.
 Also, the LDA approach will extended in order to expressly bridge between
 LDA-inferred topics and 
\emph on
a-priori-specified
\emph default
 themes.
 The intended result seeks to demonstrate a concept of operations for literature
 research potentially useful for academic researchers and business consultants.

We describe here a

 Detecting specific major themes in the literature is our goal.
 This intent coincides closely with that of

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We look for five distinct themes that appear prominently in business-strategy
 research during the last half-century.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We employ a method called 
\emph on
Latent Dirichlet Allocation
\emph default
 (LDA), commonly used for topic analysis.
 LDA attempts to group documents by 
\emph on
topic
\emph default
.
 It is an 
\emph on
unsupervised-learning
\emph default
 method in that it does not depend on exogenous, 
\emph on
a-priori
\emph default
 assignment of documents to topic classes.
 Such algorithms probabilistically estimates the strength of association
 between each document and each topic based on statistical similarities
 in their texts.
 LDA was first described by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After training our LDA model, we examine its handling of documents known
 to preponderantly address our

 Subsequent work extends the approach in an attempt to produce a more-robust
 thematic classifier.
 These extensions are inspired by

Target audience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least three constituencies may find this work particularly interesting.
 Academic researchers represent the first.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 explicitly seeks to demonstrate the utility of topic analysis as a 
\emph on
strategy for inquiry
\emph default
.
 Topic analysis bins documents from a corpus into topically coherent latent
 topic groups.
 This aides in the localization of research content associated with a theme
 of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Business consultants are the second potential beneficiaries of topic analysis.
 Automation of text classification can reduce their barrier to accessing
 the breadth and depth of academic research related to their practice.
 Innovative ideas with potential to advance consulting practices become
 more-easily discoverable.

 It is aptly named.
 LDA attempts to infer membership in 
\emph on

 topic
\emph on

classes for each document.
 It belongs to a more-general family of methods called 
\emph on

\emph on

\emph default
 pertains to the use of 
\emph on

 logic to associate documents with topic classes.
 Rather than trying to definitively link a given document to a distinct
 class, LDA estimates the probability that the document belongs to each
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, LDA is an 
\emph on
unsupervised
\emph default
-learning approach.
 Its topic-to-document associations do not require a priori, exogenous assignmen
t of documents to topics.
 Such associations are expensive, usually manually produced by subject-matter
 experts (SMEs) for a subset of a corpus.
 Unsupervised-learning methods give us a path to minimize the use of expensive
 SME labor to make topic associations.

 Specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr\left\{ \textrm{Term}\mid\textrm{Topic}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the probability that a given topic produces the corresponding term.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr\left\{ \textrm{Topic}\mid\textrm{Document}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the probability that a given document is associated with a particular
 topic.
 We can alternatively get

As with many unsupervised-learning methods, we must specify the quantity
 of topics to which the LDA model allocates probabilities.
 This occurs through a combination of analysts' judgment and trial and error.

 them statistically.
 We pick the model with the best statistical scores.

 might also inform our decision regarding the number of LDA clusters to
 fit the model.

 between themes attributed to the known-theme documents.
 We see considerable overlap, for example, between 
\emph on

 Similarly, the

 What's the difference?

 distinguishes between 
\emph on

 Semantics addresses the implicit meaning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 makes clear that LDA makes no inferences about documents' semantics: The
 meaning intended by the author.
 
\emph on
Topics
\emph default
 inferred by LDA are derived from the syntax.
 LDA operates on documents' syntax: Vocabulary and, to a lesser extent,
 grammar.
 In fact, LDA's derivation makes use 
\emph on

\emph default
, a prominent result from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Exchangeabilty explicitly proscribes against any assumptions about ordering
 of the terms in documents.
 The resulting groupings may be more informationally-rich than those from
 other machine-learning methods.
 They remain nonetheless syntactic derivatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Themes, in contrast, reside in the realm of 
\emph on

 When distinct themes' lexicons overlap significantly, bridging between
 semantics and syntax requires inductive logic, at which statistical algorithms

More to it than that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our cursory demonstration here focuses on five distinct themes.
 The last 40 years of business-strategy discourse has covered many more
 topics than these.
 Our cursory model employed ten latent-topic classes to look for five themes.
 The 5,500-document, 
\begin_inset Formula $1.25\times10^{6}$
\end_inset

-word corpus spans a diverse set of concepts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond that, many documents will span multiple topics.
 This will become particulary pronounced as we move from only titles and
 abstracts to full-text articles.
 Figure

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Orthodoxy in the applied-statistics community holds that greater quantities

 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for a contrarian view.) Titles and abstracts provide an easy starting point.
 Most publishers make them generally available.
 They suffice to exercise the end-to-end topic-modeling machinery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Expanding the corpus to full-text articles will be the next step.
 This represents a tradeoff.
 Full-text articles will not be accessible for all journals.
 In terms of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether to mix in documents, for which only title and abstract are available
 with full-text documents will be weighed.
 Fortunately, the journals for which full-text articles are accessible account
 for a majority of the documents.

 Getting LDA-inferred topics that more-closely coincide with themes may
 be enhanced by making more-extensive use of the grammatical structure of
 the corpus.
 More-advanced annotation allows us to pull in more grammatical information

 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 illustrates a dimensional analysis of the vocabulary space.
