A novel combination of Natural-Language Processing (NLP) and Machine-Learning (ML) techniques provides some ability to demonstrate between known-theme documents a corpus comprised of articles from a leading research journal. A presentation to the [2020 INFORMS Annual Meeting](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/annual2020/) updates previous work <a href="#Hamlett2020">[Hamlet2020]</a>. The stage is set to extend results through expansion of the corpus to include other journals, sharpening the annotation, and extending the ML approach to account for users' beliefs about the appropriateness of thematic groupings.

A corpus of more than 3,000 full-text journal articles spanning 40 years provides the corpus. These articles are drawn from a single journal, [*Strategic Management Journal*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970266). The corpus contains more than 27 million words. Training a combined NLP-ML method using the corpus groups included documents into clusters. Applying the resulting model to 22 known-theme documents — corresponding to five prominent business-strategy themes — "calibrates" the clusters. This allows consideration of whether other documents in the corpus correspond to a-priori-defined themes.

## Executive Summary.

Finding other documents that correspond to a document of interest is a common challenge in research. Academic researchers seek support for their theses. Determining originality is a common challenge in intellectual property.

Key words represent the most common method for searching literature. Many publications explicitly provide keyword attributes as metadata. Searching





## Motivation and Objective.

Employment of *all-available* information to find documents that are thematically similar to given ones comprises the objective. Conventional keyword searches employ only metadata about documents in a corpus. The combined NLP-ML approach employs the full document text. Determination by researchers about appropriateness of thematic associations provides another source.
